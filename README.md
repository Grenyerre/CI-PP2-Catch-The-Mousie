# **Catch The Mousie! - Code Institute Portfolio Project 2**

Welcome to 'Catch The Mousie!', a game of chance where the player attempts to feed a hungry cat.
To do this, they must predict from which hole a mouse will appear and direct the cat to the same hole.

Project Aim: Construct an interactive front-end application which responds to the user's actions. The site will alter the information it displays depending on the user's actions.

## **User Experience (UX) & Design**

The website is a single-serving site (SSS). My final design is simple and prioritizes the game play area. Neither the setting or control buttons interfere with the game play area.

### **User Stories**

- As a user/player, I would like to see the title of the application at the top of the display.
- As a user/player, I would like to be able to view game play instructions without having to open another tab/follow a link.
- As a user/plater, I would like to be able to easily exit these instructions and return to the game play.
- As a user/player, I would like to toggle the playback of the music and sound effects.
- As a user/player, I would like the option of resetting the game at any point.
- As a user/player, I would like feedback on my recent play (whether I scored a point or not).
- As a user/player, I would like an ongoing update of my score.
- As a user/player, I would like to settings and control buttons to be easily visible and identifiable.

### **Wireframe**

The wireframe was created using Balsamiq.

### **Colour Choice**

The colour palette was created using [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel).
Base colour: #D467F0
Colour harmony: Shades
As the images in the game play area are monochromatic, I wanted to utilize colours in the surrounding area. I wanted to have sufficient contrast between the settings and control buttons, and the background.

### **Font Choice**

The font is taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). It is called Englebert.

## **Features**

### **Favicon**

The favicon was created using [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/).
I used the image of the cat from the application's landing screen.

### **Settings Buttons**

These are located at the top centre of the display. They allow the user to view the instructions, toggle the music and effects on and off, and reset the game.

- Upon clicking the 'INSTRUCTIONS' button, a modal appears containing written instructions of the game play. The modal can be closed by either clicking the close button, labelled 'It's time to eat!', or by clicking anywhere outside of the modal.
- Upon landing, the music and effects are muted.
- Upon clicking the 'RESET' button, the page will reload and all current score information will be lost.

### **Game Play Area**

This is the largest section of the page and displays the images of the game's protagonist and antagonist. These images reflect the actions of the player and the computer choice. They also vary at the end of the game to reflect the cat's state of satiety.

### **Score Area**

Here is displayed in numbers how many mice have been caught (eaten!) and how many have escaped.

### **Game Prompt Area**

Messages are displayed here to inform the player of the required action, the result of their actions, and the final ccore messages.

### **Control Buttons**

These allow the player to input their choice of which hole they believe the mouse will appear; left, centre, or right.

### **Footer**

Boiler plate referring to the site's author.

## **Ideas In Development**

- Increase the number of holes from which the mouse can escape to five. Probability: 70%.
- To separate the music and sound effects so that they can be toggled on/off independently. Probability: 50%.
- Alter the game graphics to allow the user to choose the cat's colouring; black, tortoiseshell, ginger, grey. Probability: 10%.
