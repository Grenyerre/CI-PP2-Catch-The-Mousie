# **Catch The Mousie! - Code Institute Portfolio Project 2**

Welcome to 'Catch The Mousie!', a game of chance where the player attempts to feed a hungry cat.
To do this, they must predict from which hole a mouse will appear and direct the cat to the same hole.

Project Aim: Construct an interactive front-end application which responds to the user's actions. The site will alter the information it displays depending on the user's actions.

## **User Experience (UX) & Design**

The website is a single-serving site (SSS). My final design is simple and prioritizes the game play area. Neither the setting or control buttons interfere with the game play area.

## **User Stories**
+ As a user/player, I would like to see the title of the application at the top of the display.
+ As a user/player, I would like to be able to view game play instructions without having to open another tab/follow a link.
+ As a user/plater, I would like to be able to easily exit these instructions and return to the game play.
+ As a user/player, I would like to toggle the playback of the music and sound effects.
+ As a user/player, I would like the option of resetting the game at any point.
+ As a user/player, I would like feedback on my recent play (whether I scored a point or not).
+ As a user/player, I would like an ongoing update of my score.
+ As a user/player, I would like to settings and control buttons to be easily visible and identifiable.
